## Introduction

The Chat Application is designed to facilitate real-time communication between multiple clients connected to a central server. It enables users to exchange messages and engage in conversations over a network.

## Features

- Allows multiple clients to connect to a central server simultaneously.
- Clients can send and receive messages in real-time.
- Each client is assigned a random color for their messages to provide visual distinction.
- Handles client disconnection and reconnection gracefully.

## Installation

To use the Chat Application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment.
3. Compile the server and client code.
4. Run the server executable on a host machine.
5. Run the client executable on each client machine and connect to the server using the specified IP address and port number.

## Usage

Once the server is running and clients are connected, users can:

- Send messages by typing in the client console and pressing Enter.
- View messages from other connected clients in the console.
- Disconnect from the server by typing "Quit" in the client console.
